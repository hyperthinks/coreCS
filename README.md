Description
-----------
We, Hyperthinks, are setting out to build a comprehensive course planning tool for UNC Computer Science students. We will be scraping data from the UNC Public Course catalog to create a searchable, user-centric, hub for CS students to ensure they can take the classes that best suit their interests. We will allow for filtering based on any course title, description or attribute. This will give us the opportunity to implement an auto complete feature that can create a seamless experience for our users. It’ll also allow us to experiment with different design languages to pinpoint one that would be appropriate for the content that we are trying to display.
We would also want to try and integrate different major schedules that would allow people to align their graduation requirements with courses they were interested in. These could be updated dynamically which would allow for continued tracking of graduation requirements and keep students on track in terms of graduation timelines. We would push web scraping to help cultivate a program that would contain all of the information that any UNC student would need to look for without having to search through catalog.unc.edu.
Furthermore, once the application is set up, it allows for the spread and diversification of different preferences between similar students. This could allow for students to view what students in similar majors took to fulfill the same requirements. If plausible, we would also attempt to connect Courses with their respective professors on ratemyprofessor. This would start to serve as an all in one solution for UNC Students to figure out course work and create a structured plan to approach their years at Carolina.

Our Target Audience: 
--------------------

UNC Students

Our Purpose:
-------------

Consolidate all course planning resources into one unified, intuitive interface Steps Followed:
* Predict and examine the steps followed by most UNC Students
* Identify methods to integrate these steps into one unified interface
* Estimate and implement the different authentication systems available to UNC
students to make this process as personalized but still as painless as possible. • Build out an interface that integrates a search with an auto compete, all different
sources of data, web scraped information from the UNC Catalog and more to build a full-fledged UI and application.
